WHAC-A-MOLE
As a user playing the game I want to:

[ x ] start the game by pressing a Start button
[ x ] see moles appear and disappear during the game
[ x ] be able to click on a mole and get points
[ x ] have the game stop once the time is up
[ x ] have the game display the total number of moles I clicked on 
     during the game
[ x ] start the game over without having to reset the browser
     
     As a user playing a single player game I would be delighted if:
[ x ] can set the difficulty (either speed of changes, or maximum 
     concurrent moles, or even ‘Decoy Moles’)
[ x ] can keep track of my stats (maximum points, average points, etc.) 
     between games
